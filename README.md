**The ultimate project-based guide to building real-world embedded applications in C programming**

## What is this book about?
We live in a world surrounded by electronic devices, and microcontrollers are the brains of these devices. Microcontroller programming is an essential skill in the era of Internet of Things (IoT), and this book helps you to learn this skill with projects for designing and developing embedded applications with microcontroller boards. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get to grips with the basics of digital and analog electronics.
* Design, build, program, and test a microcontroller-based system.
* Understand the importance and applications of STM32 and PIC microcontrollers.
* Discover how to connect sensors to microcontroller boards.
* Find out how to obtain sensor data via coding.
* Use microcontroller boards in real life and practical projects.

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
html, body, #map {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This STM32 PIC microcontroller book is for students, hobbyists, and engineers who want to explore the world of embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Beginners as well as more experienced users of digital electronics and microcontrollers will also find this book useful. Basic knowledge of digital circuits and C programming will be helpful but not necessary.
